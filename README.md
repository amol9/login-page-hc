### Login Page

A login page done in html+css.

Done as instructed in the youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooc6f1w6Mzg) (channel: DarkCode).

With the following differences:
1. Had to include all.css instead of font-awesome.min.css in style.css, otherwise, the icons would just show as a box with some hex digits in it.
2. Used a different background image.
3. Used a different icon (fa-key) for the password input field.
